* Jordon Biondo's ~/.emacs.d/
This is my personal Emacs configuration. 
- It's not really setup to be used by others but should work well out of the box
- if you want to full featured setup:
  1. build the clang-complete-async binary and copy it to ~/.emacs.d/
  2. install swank-js
  3. (require 'jordon-dev-mode)
